This web app will keep a synchronized supermarket list between diferent clients.

It is based in the "chat-example" for a "Node.js workplace" on C9.io by Mostafa Eweda <mo.eweda@gmail.com>.

Befer the first commit I added the checkbox (working synchronized between clients) to each line. Also added buttons for saving, loading, deleting in client and deleting in server de list. The button to delete in server (Delete File) is not working, the task can be achieved by deleting in client (Delete Data) and saving (Save File).
